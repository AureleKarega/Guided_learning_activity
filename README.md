# Stack Data Structure Implementation (Python)

## Overview
This project implements a **Stack (LIFO: Last-In-First-Out)** data structure in Python from scratch.  
The stack is built using a Python list and supports common operations: `push`, `pop`, `peek`, `is_empty`, and `size`.

## Time Complexity Analysis

| Operation   | Complexity |
|-------------|------------|
| Push        | O(1)       |
| Pop         | O(1)       |
| Peek        | O(1)       |
| is_empty    | O(1)       |
| Size        | O(1)       |

## Enterprise Web Development Example
Stacks are widely used in enterprise systems:
- **Browser history management** (back/forward navigation).
- **Undo/redo functionality** in text editors or IDEs.
- **Function call stack** in programming languages.
- **Navigation systems** where reversing paths is required.

## Running Tests
To run unit tests:
```bash
python -m unittest test_stack.py
